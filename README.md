# Week 1 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Welcome to this fifth course on deep learning. In this course, you learn about sequence models, one of the most exciting areas in deep learning. Models like recurrent neural networks or RNNs have transformed speech recognition, natural language processing and other areas. And in this course, you learn how to build these models for yourself.
